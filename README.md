Test implimentations of the  ILS (SALBP-1) from "An efficient solution to the simple assembly line balancing problem type 1 using iterated local search" (Ghandi & Masehian 2025) and the VDLS (SALBP-1 and 2 ) from "Variable-depth local search heuristic for assembly line balancing problems" (Alverez-Miranda et al.).

Note that this is my own implementation, and could be buggy!
